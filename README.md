# Vehicle Booking System

## Overview
This prject contains SQL queries for a simple **Vehicle Booking System** database.
The database includes information about users, vehicles, and bookings.
The goal of this assignment is to retrieve meaningful data suing SQL concepts such as `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and subqueries.

All final queries are stored in the [`queries.sql`](./queries.sql) file.

## Database Tables Used

- **Users** - stores customer information
- **Vehicles** - stores vehicle details
